# WISE-MISE-MCP Quality Standards & Professional Polish Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive quality standards and professional polish required for the wise-mise-mcp open source release. Based on hive analysis, this project will transition from mise-task-tools to wise-mise-mcp with UV build system migration and full professional open source readiness.

## Current State Analysis (from hive/analysis/current_state)
- Project uses hatchling build system
- Has proper pyproject.toml structure  
- Includes dev dependencies
- Needs UV migration and rename to wise-mise-mcp

## Target State
- Professional open source project ready for public consumption
- Modern UV-based Python project structure
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- Security-first development practices
- Community-ready governance and contribution guidelines

   - Integration tests (fastmcp integration)
   - Performance tests (load testing for MCP server)
   - Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Python version compatibility (3.9-3.12)

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning (safety)
   - Static code analysis (bandit)
   - Secret detection (detect-secrets)
   - License scanning (pip-licenses)

4. **Release Automation**
   - Automated versioning (semantic-release)
   - PyPI publishing
   - GitHub release notes generation
   - Documentation deployment

]
```

### Code Style Configuration

#### Ruff Configuration (.ruff.toml)
```toml
line-length = 100
target-version = "py39"
extend-select = [
    "E",      # pycodestyle errors
    "W",      # pycodestyle warnings  
    "F",      # pyflakes
    "I",      # isort
    "N",      # pep8-naming
    "UP",     # pyupgrade
    "S",      # bandit
    "B",      # flake8-bugbear
    "A",      # flake8-builtins

]

[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
"tests/*" = ["S101"]  # Allow assert in tests

[tool.ruff.isort]
known-first-party = ["wise_mise_mcp"]
```

#### MyPy Configuration (pyproject.toml)
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true

## 3. Testing Strategy & Coverage Requirements

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 90% overall
- **Critical Components**: 95% coverage
  - Core server functionality
  - Task analysis and management
  - MCP protocol implementation
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have docstring examples

### Testing Architecture

```
tests/
├── unit/                    # Unit tests (70% of test suite)
│   ├── test_analyzer.py     # Task analysis logic
│   ├── test_manager.py      # Task management
│   ├── test_models.py       # Data models
│   └── test_server.py       # Server components
├── integration/             # Integration tests (25% of test suite)
│   ├── test_mcp_server.py   # Full MCP server testing
│   ├── test_fastmcp.py      # FastMCP integration
│   └── test_workflows.py    # End-to-end workflows
├── performance/             # Performance tests (5% of test suite)
│   ├── test_large_projects.py
│   └── test_concurrent_requests.py
└── fixtures/                # Test data
    ├── sample_projects/
    └── mock_responses/
```

### Test Quality Standards
- All tests must be deterministic
- No external dependencies in unit tests
- Integration tests use Docker containers when needed
- Performance tests must have baseline metrics
- All tests must clean up after themselves

---

## 4. Security Best Practices

### Security Checklist

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs validated with Pydantic models
   - Path traversal protection for file operations
   - Command injection prevention
   - Size limits on all inputs

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
   - Vulnerability scanning in CI
   - Pinned dependency versions
   - License compliance checking

3. **Runtime Security**
   - No execution of arbitrary code
   - Sandboxed file operations
   - Rate limiting for MCP requests
   - Structured logging for security events

4. **Secrets Management**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Environment variable validation
   - Secure defaults
   - Clear documentation of security requirements

### Security Scanning Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Run Bandit Security Scan
  run: bandit -r wise_mise_mcp/ -f json -o bandit-report.json

- name: Safety Check
  run: safety check --json --output safety-report.json

- name: Detect Secrets
  run: detect-secrets scan --all-files --baseline .secrets.baseline
```

## 5. Release Automation & Versioning

### Semantic Versioning Strategy
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to MCP protocol or public API
- **MINOR**: New features, tool additions, non-breaking enhancements
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, internal improvements

### Release Process

1. **Automated Version Bumping**
   - Conventional commits for automated versioning
   - Semantic-release for version management
   - Automatic changelog generation

2. **Release Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   - name: Semantic Release
     uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v3
     with:
       semantic_version: 19
       extra_plugins: |
         @semantic-release/commit-analyzer
         @semantic-release/release-notes-generator
         @semantic-release/changelog
         @semantic-release/github
   ```

3. **Distribution**
   - PyPI publishing with trusted publishers
   - GitHub releases with assets
   - Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
