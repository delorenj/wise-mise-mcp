# Smithery Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The Smithery deployment was failing with "No test configuration found for this server" error, followed by a 15-minute timeout and INTERNAL_ERROR status.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Test Configuration
- **Problem**: smithery.yaml lacked proper `configSchema` and `testConfiguration` sections
- **Error**: "No test configuration found for this server. Using a best guess."
- **Impact**: Smithery couldn't validate the MCP server, leading to timeout

### Secondary Issues
1. **Dockerfile Missing curl**: Health check used curl but didn't install it
2. **Known Smithery Bug**: WebSocket relay infrastructure issues causing timeouts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated smithery.yaml Configuration
Added comprehensive test configuration:

```yaml
runtime: "container"
build:
  dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
  dockerBuildPath: "."
startCommand:
  type: "http"
  configSchema:
    type: object
    properties:
      timeout:
        type: number
        default: 30000
        description: "Request timeout in milliseconds"
      port:
        type: number
        default: 3000
        description: "Server port"
    required: []
  testConfiguration:
    enabled: true
    timeout: 60000
    healthCheck:
      path: "/mcp"
      expectedStatus: 200
    tests:
      - name: "Server Health"
        type: "http"
        path: "/mcp"
        method: "GET"
      - name: "MCP Protocol"
        type: "mcp"
        requests:
          - method: "initialize"
            params:
              protocolVersion: "2024-11-05"
              capabilities: {}
          - method: "tools/list"
```

### 2. Fixed Dockerfile
Added curl installation for health check:
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    git \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Smithery will find proper test configuration
- ✅ MCP server health checks will pass
- ✅ Deployment will complete without timeout
- ✅ Server will be properly validated during scanning

## Alternative Workaround
If Smithery infrastructure issues persist, users can bypass Smithery and use direct MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wise-mise-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "wise_mise_mcp.server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- Configuration follows Smithery's expected schema format
- Test configuration includes both HTTP health checks and MCP protocol validation
- Timeout increased to 60 seconds to allow for proper server initialization
- All changes are backward compatible with existing deployments
