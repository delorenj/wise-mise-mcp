**Examples**:
- Rust ecosystem expert (Cargo, clippy, rustfmt workflows)
- Modern frontend frameworks (Vite, Astro, SvelteKit patterns)
- Cloud-native development (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform tasks)
- Database workflows (migration patterns, seeding strategies)

```python
# Your framework expertise becomes intelligent automation
class SvelteKitExpert(DomainExpert):
    """Expert in SvelteKit application development patterns."""
    
    def analyze_tasks(self, project: ProjectStructure) -> List[TaskDefinition]:
        tasks = []
        
        if self._has_sveltekit(project):
            # Your knowledge becomes automation
            tasks.extend([
                self._create_dev_task(),
                self._create_build_tasks(),
                self._create_testing_strategy(),
                self._create_deployment_pipeline()
            ])
            
        return tasks
```

### 🛠️ **Tool Innovation** - *Shape the Future*

**What**: Create new CLI commands or MCP tools that extend Wise Mise's capabilities.

- A `doctor` command for checking environment health.
- Visual task dependency graphs (either via CLI or MCP).
- Performance analysis and optimization suggestions.
- Integration with popular IDEs and editors.
- Advanced project health metrics.

```python
@app.tool()
async def visualize_task_dependencies(request: VisualizationRequest) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate interactive dependency graphs for complex projects."""
    # Your innovation becomes everyone's superpower
```

### 📚 **Documentation Excellence** - *Developer Experience Champion*

## 📏 **Code Excellence Standards**

### Python Style - Beyond PEP 8

We maintain standards that reflect our commitment to excellence:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Protocol, runtime_checkable
from pathlib import Path
from dataclasses import dataclass

from .models import TaskDefinition, TaskDomain, ProjectStructure


@runtime_checkable
class DomainExpert(Protocol):
    """Protocol defining the interface for domain expertise."""
    
    def analyze_project(self, project: ProjectStructure) -> List[TaskDefinition]:
        """Analyze project and provide intelligent task recommendations.
        
        Args:
            project: Analyzed project structure with detected technologies,
                    frameworks, and development patterns.
                    
        Returns:
            List of intelligently crafted task definitions optimized for
            the detected technology stack and development workflow.
            
        Example:
            >>> expert = ReactExpert()
            >>> tasks = expert.analyze_project(project_structure)
            >>> assert any(task.domain == TaskDomain.BUILD for task in tasks)
            >>> assert any("npm run build" in task.run for task in tasks)
        """
        ...


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class TaskRecommendation:
    """Immutable recommendation with contextual intelligence."""
    
    task: TaskDefinition
    reasoning: str
    priority: int = 5  # 1-10 scale
    estimated_effort: str = "medium"  # low, medium, high, complex
    
    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        """Validate recommendation integrity."""
        if not (1 <= self.priority <= 10):
            raise ValueError(f"Priority must be 1-10, got {self.priority}")
```

### Documentation Standards

Every public API deserves excellent documentation:

```python
def create_intelligent_tasks(
    self,
    project_path: Path,
    force_complexity: Optional[TaskComplexity] = None
) -> TaskCreationResult:
    """Create intelligent mise tasks based on deep project analysis.
    
    This method represents the core intelligence of Wise Mise. It analyzes
    the project's technology stack, development patterns, and existing 
    configuration to generate a comprehensive set of optimally organized tasks.
    
    Args:
        project_path: Path to the project root directory. Must contain
                     recognizable project files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
        force_complexity: Override automatic complexity detection. Useful for
                         testing or when you know your requirements better than
                         the analyzer.
                         
    Returns:
        TaskCreationResult containing:
        - created_tasks: List of successfully created task definitions
        - skipped_tasks: Tasks skipped due to conflicts or conditions
        - recommendations: Additional suggestions for manual consideration
        - architecture_analysis: Insights about project structure and patterns
        
    Raises:
        ProjectAnalysisError: When project structure cannot be analyzed
        TaskCreationError: When task creation fails due to configuration issues
        
    Example:
        >>> manager = TaskManager(Path("./my-nextjs-app"))
        >>> result = manager.create_intelligent_tasks()
        >>> print(f"Created {len(result.created_tasks)} optimized tasks")
        >>> print(f"Recommendations: {result.recommendations}")
        
    Note:
        This method embodies years of expertise in development workflow 
        optimization. The generated tasks follow mise best practices and
        are designed for maintainability, performance, and developer experience.
    """

    ])
    def test_end_to_end_task_creation(self, project_type, sample_projects):
        """Full workflow: analyze → recommend → create → validate."""
        project_path = sample_projects[project_type]
        
        # This is how users will actually use our tool
        analyzer = TaskAnalyzer(project_path)
        recommendations = analyzer.get_task_recommendations()
        
        assert len(recommendations) > 0
        assert all(rec.task.domain in TaskDomain for rec in recommendations)
        
        # Validate that created tasks actually work
        manager = TaskManager(project_path)
        result = manager.create_task_intelligently(
            "Build production bundle with optimization"
        )
        
        assert result["success"] is True

# Performance Tests - Keep It Lightning Fast
@pytest.mark.performance  
def test_large_project_analysis_performance(large_monorepo_fixture):
    """Ensure we can handle enterprise-scale projects efficiently."""
    import time
    
    start_time = time.time()
    analyzer = TaskAnalyzer(large_monorepo_fixture)  # 10,000+ files
    recommendations = analyzer.get_task_recommendations()
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert elapsed < 5.0, f"Analysis took {elapsed:.2f}s, should be under 5s"
    assert len(recommendations) > 10, "Should find meaningful tasks in large projects"
```
